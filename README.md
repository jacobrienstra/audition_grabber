# Audition Grabber

A chrome extension that parses an audition posting (currently only on broadwayworld.com, and allow you to add it to your calendar, with either a .ics file download or a google calendar link.

## How To Use

You literally just click the extension icon.

You can also right click to go to the options page, which as of now includes the optinon to use either Apple or Google calendar formats, and to set which sections of the BWayworld.com listing you wish to include in the event description.

## Dependencies

The tool uses 2 libraries from the following projects:

- [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
- [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js)
- [ics.js](https://github.com/acciojacob/ics.js)
- [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/, https://momentjs.com/timezone/)

I've compressed and combined them.
